# Welbeing:
What are our individual welling plans during this project?

| Name    | Plan                                                                                                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shaneel | Spend weekend with partner and therefore will not have as much time to do project work.                        |
| Louis   | Be flexible with break timings and have lulls in pace throughout the day to breakup intense coding sessions.   |
| Moo     | Listen to his body, especially when he starts getting a headache. Also going for walks to de-stress.           |
| Aaron   | Regular breaks and flexibility in lunch timings and after hours work so he can plan things outside of project. |

# Expectations:
Not expected to put in hours after 5pm or weekend. If you feel like working after hours if you're really into your work, please feel free to do so.
Conflicts will be resolved using the steps outlined within the conflicts section (as agreed by the team).

# Decisions:
Big decisions will be made as a team during the planning stage and granular/implementation decisions will be made by the developer(s) working on the specific feature. If required, decision making can be assisted by overseeing roles like Frontend or Backend leads, Product Owners, etc.

# Asking For Help:
Spend a maximum of 15 minutes being stuck and then ask another team member for help. If stuck on same problem as a pair/team for more than 10 minutes, ask for help from a facilitator.

# Inclusion:
Here everyone out during team discussions and pairing sessions. Don't shut down ideas straight away and be willing to discuss the merits of your ideas using non violent communication and in an objective manner.

# Conversations:
Make a judgement call on who needs to be within a conversation based on your understanding of the work you and everyone else is doing. Also know that there are daily stand ups and retrospectives at the end of each sprint if your conversation can wait until then. We are also flexible to call informal (quick) stand ups whenever required.

# How will we work together?
We will choose to use the following agile tools:
1. Stand ups (1 in the morning and no limit on impromptu stand ups as required).
2. 2 day sprints
3. Quick retros at the end of sprints
4. Kanban board planning with the help of facilitators.

# Survival Plan:
### Keep things light hearted, join in on the fun if we are messing around in the mornings/afternoons and be open to grab lunch together or to grab a drink one afternoon! Do stuff quiz as a team (once a day).

| Shaneel | If he is quiet and is at the computer for too long without getting up, he is stressed! Snap him out of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Moo     | Goes quiet and might need to go for a walk if feeling stressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Louis   | Hard to tell if he is stressed. Tends to get frustrated more than stressed and enjoys pair programming when frustrated.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Aaron   | Appears distracted, finds out difficult to focus on other things (trying to problem solve in my head), - a bit more short/less patient. Thoughts/ideas jumping all over the place. -> encourage me to take a break and do something different for a bit before coming back and approaching the problem methodically. |
